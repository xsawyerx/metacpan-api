# NAME

MetaCPAN::API - (DEPRECATED) A comprehensive, DWIM-featured API to MetaCPAN

# DEPRECATED

**THIS MODULE IS DEPRECATED, DO NOT USE!**

This module has been completely rewritten to address a multitude
of problems, and is now available under the new official name:
[MetaCPAN::Client](https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN%3A%3AClient).

Please do not use this module.

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
# simple usage
my $mcpan  = MetaCPAN::API->new();
my $author = $mcpan->author('XSAWYERX');
my $dist   = $mcpan->release( distribution => 'MetaCPAN-API' );

# advanced usage with cache (contributed by Kent Fredric)
require CHI;
require WWW::Mechanize::Cached;
require HTTP::Tiny::Mech;
require MetaCPAN::API;

my $mcpan = MetaCPAN::API->new(
  ua => HTTP::Tiny::Mech->new(
    mechua => WWW::Mechanize::Cached->new(
      cache => CHI->new(
        driver => 'File',
        root_dir => '/tmp/metacpan-cache',
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

# DESCRIPTION

This was the original hopefully-complete API-compliant interface to MetaCPAN
([https://metacpan.org](https://metacpan.org)).  It has now been superseded by [MetaCPAN::Client](https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN%3A%3AClient).

# ATTRIBUTES

## `base_url`

```perl
my $mcpan = MetaCPAN::API->new(
    base_url => 'http://localhost:9999',
);
```

This attribute is used for REST requests. You should set it to where the
MetaCPAN is accessible. By default it's already set correctly, but if you're
running a local instance of MetaCPAN, or use a local mirror, or tunnel it
through a local port, or any of those stuff, you would want to change this.

Default: _https://fastapi.metacpan.org/v1_.

This attribute is read-only (immutable), meaning that once it's set on
initialize (via `new()`), you cannot change it. If you need to, create a
new instance of MetaCPAN::API. Why is it immutable? Because it's better.

## `ua`

This attribute is used to contain the user agent used for running the REST
request to the server. It is specifically set to [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ATiny), so if you
want to set it manually, make sure it's of HTTP::Tiny.

HTTP::Tiny is used as part of the philosophy of keeping it tiny.

This attribute is read-only (immutable), meaning that once it's set on
initialize (via `new()`), you cannot change it. If you need to, create a
new instance of MetaCPAN::API. Why is it immutable? Because it's better.

## `ua_args`

```perl
my $mcpan = MetaCPAN::API->new(
    ua_args => [ agent => 'MyAgent' ],
);
```

The arguments that will be given to the [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ATiny) user agent.

This attribute is read-only (immutable), meaning that once it's set on
initialize (via `new()`), you cannot change it. If you need to, create a
new instance of MetaCPAN::API. Why is it immutable? Because it's better.

The default is a user agent string: **MetaCPAN::API/$version**.

# METHODS

## `fetch`

```perl
my $result = $mcpan->fetch('/release/distribution/Moose');

# with parameters
my $more = $mcpan->fetch(
    '/release/distribution/Moose',
    param => 'value',
);
```

This is a helper method for API implementations. It fetches a path from
MetaCPAN, decodes the JSON from the content variable and returns it.

You don't really need to use it, but you can in case you want to write your
own extension implementation to MetaCPAN::API.

It accepts an additional hash as `GET` parameters.

## `post`

```perl
# /release&content={"query":{"match_all":{}},"filter":{"prefix":{"archive":"Cache-Cache-1.06"}}}
my $result = $mcpan->post(
    'release',
    {
        query  => { match_all => {} },
        filter => { prefix => { archive => 'Cache-Cache-1.06' } },
    },
);
```

The POST equivalent of the `fetch()` method. It gets the path and JSON request.
